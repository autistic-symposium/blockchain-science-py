## 🧱👵🏽 inspecting blockchains with foundry's vm

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

##### 🛠 we leverage [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) to analyze evm-based blockchains. foundry provides **["vm cheatcodes"](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/12/introducing-the-foundry-ethereum-development-toolbox#you-should-be-able-to-override-vm-state-in-your-tests)**, allowing easy methods to modify the chain state at test runtime (for instance, simulating previous blocks).


##### 🕹 these boilerplates can be expanded for several purposes, including testing vulnerabilities or extracting mev data.
